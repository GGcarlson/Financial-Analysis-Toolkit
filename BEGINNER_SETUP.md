## Step 2: Get the Financial Analysis Toolkit

### Option A: Download from GitHub (Easiest)

1. **Go to the project page:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/GGcarlson/Financial-Analysis-Toolkit
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Click "Download ZIP"

2. **Extract the files:**
   - **Windows**: Right-click the ZIP file ‚Üí "Extract All" ‚Üí Choose a location like `C:\Users\YourName\Financial-Analysis-Toolkit`
   - **Mac**: Double-click the ZIP file, it will extract automatically
   - **Linux**: `unzip Financial-Analysis-Toolkit-main.zip`

### Option B: Using Git (If you have Git installed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GGcarlson/Financial-Analysis-Toolkit.git
```

---

## Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\YourName\Financial-Analysis-Toolkit
```
(Replace `YourName` with your actual username)

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/Financial-Analysis-Toolkit
# or wherever you extracted it
```

**üí° Tip**: You can also drag the folder into your terminal/command prompt to get the correct path.

---

## Step 4: Set Up the Environment

This creates a separate space for the toolkit so it doesn't interfere with other software.

### Windows

```cmd
REM Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv312

REM Activate it
venv312\Scripts\activate

REM You should see (venv312) at the start of your command prompt
```

### Mac/Linux

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# You should see (venv) at the start of your command prompt
```

---

## Step 5: Install the Toolkit

Make sure you're in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(venv312)` or `(venv)` in your command prompt).

```bash
# Upgrade pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the toolkit
python -m pip install -e .
```

This might take a minute as it downloads and installs everything needed.

---

## Step 6: Verify Installation

Let's make sure everything works:

```bash
# Check if the CLI is available
finance-cli --help

# List available strategies
finance-cli list-strategies

# Run a quick test
finance-cli retire --strategy dummy --years 5 --paths 10
```

You should see output without errors. If you get errors, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

---

## Step 7: Your First Retirement Simulation

Now let's run a real retirement simulation! We'll use the classic "4% rule":

```bash
finance-cli retire --strategy four_percent_rule --years 30 --paths 100
```

**What this does:**
- Simulates a 30-year retirement
- Uses the 4% withdrawal rule (withdraw 4% of your initial balance each year)
- Runs 100 different market scenarios
- Assumes you start with $1,000,000

**You should see output like:**
```
Running retirement simulation...
Strategy: four_percent_rule
Years: 30
Paths: 100
Success rate: 94.0%
Median final balance: $1,234,567
```

üéâ **Congratulations!** You just ran your first retirement simulation!

---

## Step 8: Customize with Your Data

Now let's use your actual financial situation. Replace these numbers with your own:

```bash
finance-cli retire \
  --strategy four_percent_rule \
  --years 30 \
  --paths 500 \
  --init-balance 750000 \
  --equity-pct 0.7 \
  --age 55 \
  --fees-bps 75
```

**What each parameter means:**
- `--init-balance 750000`: You have $750,000 saved
- `--equity-pct 0.7`: 70% of your portfolio is in stocks
- `--age 55`: You're 55 years old
- `--fees-bps 75`: Your investment fees are 0.75% per year
- `--paths 500`: Run 500 different market scenarios (more = more reliable)

---

## Step 9: Include Taxes

If you want to account for taxes on your withdrawals:

```bash
finance-cli retire \
  --strategy four_percent_rule \
  --years 30 \
  --paths 500 \
  --init-balance 750000 \
  --equity-pct 0.7 \
  --age 55 \
  --tax single
```

Use `--tax single` if you're single, or `--tax married` if you're married filing jointly.

---

## Step 10: Save Your Results

To save the detailed results to a file:

```bash
finance-cli retire \
  --strategy four_percent_rule \
  --years 30 \
  --paths 500 \
  --init-balance 750000 \
  --equity-pct 0.7 \
  --age 55 \
  --tax single \
  --output my_retirement_results.csv
```

This creates a CSV file you can open in Excel or Google Sheets.

---

## Understanding Your Results

### Key Metrics Explained

**Success Rate**: Percentage of scenarios where your money lasted the full retirement period
- 95%+ = Very safe
- 90-95% = Generally safe
- 80-90% = Moderate risk
- Below 80% = High risk

**Median Final Balance**: The middle value of your ending balance across all scenarios
- Higher = More money left over
- Lower = Less cushion

**Percentiles**: Show the range of possible outcomes
- 10th percentile = Worst 10% of scenarios
- 90th percentile = Best 10% of scenarios

### Sample Interpretation

```
Success rate: 92.0%
Median final balance: $1,234,567
10th percentile: $234,567
90th percentile: $2,345,678
```

**This means:**
- 92% chance your money lasts 30 years
- In half the scenarios, you end with $1.2M+
- In the worst 10% of scenarios, you still have $234K+
- In the best 10% of scenarios, you have $2.3M+

---

## Common Strategies to Try

### 1. Four Percent Rule (Conservative)
```bash
finance-cli retire --strategy four_percent_rule --years 30 --paths 500
```
- Withdraw 4% of initial balance, adjusted for inflation
- Very conservative approach

### 2. Constant Percentage (Dynamic)
```bash
finance-cli retire --strategy constant_pct --percent 0.035 --years 30 --paths 500
```
- Withdraw 3.5% of current balance each year
- Adjusts automatically to market performance

### 3. Guyton-Klinger (Adaptive)
```bash
finance-cli retire --strategy guyton_klinger --years 30 --paths 500
```
- Increases withdrawals in good years
- Decreases withdrawals in bad years
- Good balance of income and safety

---

## Using Configuration Files

For complex scenarios, create a configuration file:

**Create a file called `my_retirement.yml`:**
```yaml
strategy: four_percent_rule
years: 30
paths: 1000
init_balance: 750000.0
equity_pct: 0.7
fees_bps: 75
age: 55
tax_filing_status: single
output: my_results.csv
verbose: true
```

**Run it:**
```bash
finance-cli retire --config my_retirement.yml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ‚ùå `'finance-cli' is not recognized`

**Problem**: The CLI command isn't found
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the right directory and virtual environment is activated

```bash
# Windows
venv312\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux  
source venv/bin/activate

# Then try again
finance-cli --help
```

#### ‚ùå `No module named 'capstone_finance'`

**Problem**: Package not installed correctly
**Solution**: Reinstall the package

```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### ‚ùå `ERROR: Package 'capstone-finance' requires a different Python`

**Problem**: Your Python version is too old
**Solution**: Install Python 3.11 or higher (see Step 1)

#### ‚ùå `The system cannot find the path specified`

**Problem**: You're not in the right directory
**Solution**: Navigate to the project directory

```bash
# Windows - find where you extracted it
dir
cd Financial-Analysis-Toolkit

# Mac/Linux
ls
cd Financial-Analysis-Toolkit
```

#### ‚ùå `Permission denied` errors

**Problem**: Installation permissions
**Solution**: Use user installation

```bash
pip install --user -e .
```

#### ‚ùå Commands run but no output

**Problem**: Missing parameters
**Solution**: Add required parameters

```bash
# Instead of just: finance-cli retire
# Use: finance-cli retire --strategy four_percent_rule --years 30 --paths 100
```
