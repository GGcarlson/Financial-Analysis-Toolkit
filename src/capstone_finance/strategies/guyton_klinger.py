"""Guyton-Klinger Guardrails Strategy implementation.

This strategy implements dynamic withdrawal adjustments based on portfolio performance
using upper and lower guardrails. The withdrawal rate is adjusted when the portfolio
value crosses certain thresholds relative to the initial withdrawal amount.

    """Dynamic withdrawal strategy with guardrails.

    The Guyton-Klinger strategy adjusts withdrawals based on portfolio performance:
    - Increases withdrawals when portfolio performs well (upper guardrail)
    - Decreases withdrawals when portfolio underperforms (lower guardrail)
    - Implements prosperity rule: no cuts when portfolio > 120% of initial
    - Implements capital preservation rule: no raises when portfolio < 80% of initial

    Note: Due to the stateless nature of the base strategy interface, this implementation
    uses a simplified approach where guardrails are checked against the current portfolio
    value rather than a multi-year average. State tracking for cumulative inflation and
    portfolio history would require architectural changes to the simulation framework.
