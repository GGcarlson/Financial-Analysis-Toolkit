An extensible, agent-friendly Python toolkit that lets individuals, advisors, and autonomous LLM agents simulate personal-finance decisions‚Äîretirement withdrawals, mortgage refinancing, large purchases, etc.‚Äîwith academic-quality rigor and production-grade code.

## üöÄ New to This? Start Here!

**üëã First time user?** Check out our [**Beginner Setup Guide**](BEGINNER_SETUP.md) for a complete step-by-step walkthrough, including:
- Platform-specific installation (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Your first retirement simulation
- Common troubleshooting solutions
- Real examples with your own financial data

**‚ö° Already familiar with Python?** Jump to the [Quick Start](#-quick-start) section below.

## üéØ Vision

Build a toolkit that is:

- **Composable**: New strategies, simulators, or data feeds drop in via plug-ins‚Äîno fork required
- **Deterministic**: Given a seed + config, results are reproducible across machines
- **Fast**: 10,000 40-year Monte-Carlo paths in < 2 s on a modern laptop
- **LLM-native**: Public APIs documented with machine-readable DSPy signatures so Claude Code (or any agent) can reason about them

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install capstone-finance
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import capstone_finance as cf

# Create a retirement simulation
simulator = cf.RetirementSimulator(
    portfolio_value=1_000_000,
    strategy="4percent",
    years=30,
    seed=42
)

# Run simulation
results = simulator.run()
print(f"Success rate: {results.success_rate:.1%}")
```

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Run a retirement analysis
finance-cli retire --strategy four_percent_rule --years 30 --seed 42

# Use a configuration file
finance-cli retire --config examples/retirement_basic.yml

# Override config with CLI flags (CLI takes precedence)
finance-cli retire --config examples/retirement_basic.yml --years 40 --strategy guyton_klinger
```

### Configuration Files

Complex simulations can be defined in YAML configuration files instead of using many CLI flags:

```yaml
# retirement_config.yml
strategy: guyton_klinger
years: 30
paths: 1000
init_balance: 1000000.0
equity_pct: 0.6

# Guyton-Klinger specific parameters
initial_rate: 0.05
guard_pct: 0.20
raise_pct: 0.10
cut_pct: 0.10

output: "results.csv"
verbose: true
```

See [`examples/`](examples/) directory for complete configuration examples.

## üìä Core Features

### Strategy Plugins
- **4% Rule (Bengen)**: Classic fixed withdrawal rate
- **Constant Percentage**: Dynamic percentage-based withdrawals
- **Endowment (Yale)**: Moving average approach
- **Guyton-Klinger**: Guardrails-based adjustments

### Scenario Simulators
- **Retirement Planning**: Portfolio longevity & success metrics
- **Refinance Analysis**: IRR, break-even, NPV calculations
- **Big Purchase Modeling**: Opportunity cost vs cash flow impact

### Data Sources
- Historical returns: Shiller S&P data via pandas-datareader
- Inflation: BLS CPI-U with monthly cache updates
- Yield curves: FRED DGS10 (optional, for glidepath calculations)

## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GGcarlson/Financial-Analysis-Toolkit.git
cd Financial-Analysis-Toolkit

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Lint code
ruff check .

# Type checking
mypy .

# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov

# Run pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üß™ Testing

The project maintains ‚â•90% test coverage with:

- **Unit tests**: Core functionality and algorithms
- **Property-based tests**: Numerical stability with Hypothesis
- **Integration tests**: CLI and end-to-end workflows
- **Performance benchmarks**: Monte-Carlo simulation speed

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test module
pytest tests/core/

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_strategy"

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

## üìà Performance

Target performance metrics:
- 10,000 40-year Monte-Carlo paths in < 2 seconds (P95)
- ‚â§ 1% error vs FIRECalc benchmarks on canonical cases
- Vectorized operations using NumPy/Pandas
- Optional Numba acceleration for heavy computation

## ü§ñ LLM Integration

All public APIs are annotated with DSPy signatures for seamless agent integration:

```python
@signature("retirement_analysis",
           in_=RetirementParams,
           out=RetirementResults)
def analyze_retirement(params: RetirementParams) -> RetirementResults:
    """Analyze retirement portfolio sustainability."""
    # Implementation here
```

JSON manifests are auto-generated to `/signatures` for agent consumption.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Financial Disclaimer

### Adding a New Strategy

Adding a new withdrawal strategy requires ‚â§ 20 lines of code:

```python
from capstone_finance.strategies import BaseStrategy

class MyStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def initial_withdrawal(self, state: YearState) -> float:
        return state.portfolio_value * 0.04

    def update_withdrawal(self, state: YearState) -> float:
        return self.last_withdrawal * (1 + state.inflation_rate)
```
