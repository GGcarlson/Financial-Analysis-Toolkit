# Variable Percentage Withdrawal (VPW) Strategy Example
# This configuration demonstrates how to run VPW simulations with default tables

# Core simulation parameters
strategy: "vpw"
years: 30
paths: 1000
seed: 42

# Portfolio parameters
init_balance: 1000000.0  # $1M initial portfolio
equity_pct: 0.6          # 60% equity allocation
fees_bps: 50             # 0.5% annual fees

# Market simulation parameters
market_mode: "lognormal"

# Output parameters
output: "vpw_results.csv"
verbose: true

# VPW strategy parameters
# vpw_table_path: null  # Use default VPW tables (uncomment to specify custom table)

# Note: VPW strategy automatically adjusts withdrawal percentages based on:
# 1. Current age (from simulation state)
# 2. Equity allocation (from portfolio parameters)
# 3. Current portfolio balance (from simulation state)
#
# The strategy includes built-in VPW tables for 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% equity allocations.
# Withdrawal percentages generally increase with age and decrease with higher equity allocations.
