# VPW Strategy with Custom Table Example
# This configuration demonstrates how to use a custom VPW table

# Core simulation parameters
strategy: "vpw"
years: 35
paths: 2000
seed: 123

# Portfolio parameters
init_balance: 1500000.0  # $1.5M initial portfolio
equity_pct: 0.7          # 70% equity allocation (will round to 80% table)
fees_bps: 35             # 0.35% annual fees

# Market simulation parameters
market_mode: "lognormal"

# Output parameters
output: "vpw_custom_results.csv"
verbose: true

# VPW strategy parameters
vpw_table_path: "examples/custom_vpw_table.yml"  # Path to custom VPW table

# This example demonstrates:
# 1. Using a custom VPW table with conservative withdrawal rates
# 2. 70% equity allocation (will use 80% table as closest match)
# 3. Longer simulation period (35 years)
# 4. Higher number of paths for more robust statistics
# 5. Custom initial balance and fee structure
#
# The custom table provides more conservative withdrawal rates
# compared to the default VPW tables, which may be appropriate
# for more risk-averse investors or uncertain market conditions.
