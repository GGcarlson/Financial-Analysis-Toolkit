# Custom VPW Table Example
# This file demonstrates the format for custom VPW tables

# VPW table structure:
# - Top level keys are equity allocation percentages (20, 40, 60, 80)
# - Each equity allocation contains age-based withdrawal percentages
# - Ages typically range from 45 to 95+
# - Withdrawal percentages are specified as percentages (e.g., 3.5 for 3.5%)

# Example custom VPW table with conservative withdrawal rates
20:  # 20% equity allocation
  45: 2.8
  50: 2.9
  55: 3.0
  60: 3.2
  65: 3.5
  70: 4.0
  75: 4.5
  80: 5.2
  85: 6.0
  90: 7.5
  95: 10.0

40:  # 40% equity allocation
  45: 2.5
  50: 2.6
  55: 2.7
  60: 2.9
  65: 3.2
  70: 3.7
  75: 4.2
  80: 4.8
  85: 5.6
  90: 6.8
  95: 8.5

60:  # 60% equity allocation
  45: 2.2
  50: 2.3
  55: 2.4
  60: 2.6
  65: 2.9
  70: 3.3
  75: 3.8
  80: 4.4
  85: 5.2
  90: 6.2
  95: 7.8

80:  # 80% equity allocation
  45: 2.0
  50: 2.1
  55: 2.2
  60: 2.4
  65: 2.7
  70: 3.0
  75: 3.4
  80: 3.9
  85: 4.6
  90: 5.6
  95: 7.0

# To use this custom table:
# 1. Save this file (e.g., as "my_vpw_table.yml")
# 2. Reference it in your configuration:
#    vpw_table_path: "my_vpw_table.yml"
# 3. Or use the CLI flag:
#    --vpw-table my_vpw_table.yml

# Notes:
# - The strategy will automatically select the closest equity allocation
# - Ages not in the table will be interpolated or use boundary values
# - Withdrawal percentages are capped at 10% regardless of table values
# - Higher equity allocations typically have lower withdrawal rates
# - Withdrawal percentages generally increase with age
